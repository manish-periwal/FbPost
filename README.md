# FbPost
Facebook script to comment on the posts on your timeline.

Simple script just to comment on a post that was posted by you on your timeline. 
Facebook does not allow to like a post. 
Also it does not allow to comment on other's post on your timeline.
So, automated task of commenting "Thank You" on your birthday posts and hitting like on those posts is out of the question!!
